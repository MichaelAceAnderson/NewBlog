## Introduction

NewBlog is a CMS (Content Managing system) written in PHP allowing you to post text/image content on your own blog.
It was written to learn PHP and web development in general.
The real interest of this project was to synthetize all the knowledge I had acquired in the past two years (2021-2022)
into a single project. It aims to include:

- Basic web languages (HTML, PHP, CSS, JS) with best practices
- SEO (indexation, meta tags, etc...)
- Responsive design
- Object Oriented Programming (encapsulation, inheritance, etc...)
- MVC web architecture
- Database management (procedures, views, triggers)
- Cybersecurity (prepared requests, password encryption, etc...) ⚠️ Needs penetration testing (2.0)
- Project management (Git versioning, UML, documentation, etc...)
- Testing (unit, functional, integration, performance etc...)
- Deployment & DevOps (Web server, DB server, CI/CD, Docker, etc...)
